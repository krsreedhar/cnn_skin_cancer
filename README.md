## General Information
- The model uses several images of skin cancer to train the data and to test it.
- The objective of the CNN model is to classify a type of cancer called Melanoma.
- A CNN based classification model is developed.
- To enhance the training and to avoid overfitting and class imbalances, Augmentor library is used.
- To run this notebook, place Train and Test folders in Google Drive under folder 'Skin cancer ISIC The International Skin Imaging Collaboration'

## Conclusions
- The model developed using Keras library.
